# Clubs - Clan and Friends System for Minecraft

Clubs is an advanced Minecraft plugin influenced by [MinemenClub](https://minemen.club) that brings clan systems and friend management to your server, designed for robust and scalable performance using Redis and MongoDB.

This project is **open-source**, with the goal of enabling others to learn, contribute, and create an enhanced Minecraft server experience. It was originally developed by [imhieu](https://github.com/imhieu) and later acquired by me, **@Emmy**.
